linked-data-toolkit
===================

A toolkit for doing SPARQL lookups against a number of authorities/thesauri/vocabularies.

This toolkit was originally developed to simplify the alignment of ADS metadata with various authorities, such as
the Library of Congress (LoC), Ordnance Survey (OS), Geonames, and DBPedia. Clients were developed with simple methods
for running queries against either SPARQL endpoints or RESTful interfaces. The Clients and methods were very much 
developed with the ADS uses in mind, but hopefully can be improved and extended by others as they need them.
